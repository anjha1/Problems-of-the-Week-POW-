# 🔍 Min in Sorted Rotated Array

This repository contains two Java implementations to find the **minimum element in a sorted rotated array**:

✅ **Approach 1: Binary Search** – Efficient, O(log n) time complexity  
✅ **Approach 2: Linear Search** – Simpler, but O(n) time complexity

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given a sorted and rotated array, find the minimum element in the array.

For example:  
Input: `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`  
Output: `0`
